HELP
* HAVING ISSUES WITH MONGO DB CONNECTIONS
ERROR TYPE 1: error parsing uri: lookup cluster0.xi14f.mongodb.net on 172.20.10.1:53: cannot unmarshal DNS message

ERROR TYPE 2: 
server selection error: context deadline exceeded, current topology: { Type: ReplicaSetNoPrimary, Servers: [] }


POSSIBLE SOLUTION
Verify DNS settings: Double-check your DNS settings on your Mac. You can go to "System Preferences" -> "Network" -> select your active network connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) -> click on "Advanced" -> go to the "DNS" tab. Ensure that the DNS server addresses listed there are correct and functioning. You may consider using public DNS servers like Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1).
